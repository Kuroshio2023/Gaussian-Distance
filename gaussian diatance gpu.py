## Key Optimizations

### 1. GPU Acceleration with CuPy
The original code relied on NumPy for computations, which are executed on the CPU. To leverage the parallel processing power of GPUs, we replaced NumPy with **CuPy**, a GPU-accelerated library equivalent to NumPy.

- **Replaced NumPy operations**: All matrix computations and numerical integration steps were rewritten to use CuPy.
- **Efficient Gaussian PDF computation**: A custom implementation of the Gaussian PDF was introduced to avoid using SciPyâ€™s `norm.pdf`, which is incompatible with CuPy.

---

### 2. Batch Processing for Memory Efficiency
To handle the large dataset effectively, **batch processing** was implemented for both rows and columns:

- **Batch size**: A parameterized `batch_size` was introduced to control the number of rows/columns processed in memory at a time.
- **Reduced memory footprint**: Processed batches were directly written to the distance matrix, avoiding the need to store intermediate results in RAM.

---

### 3. Numerical Integration Optimization
Gaussian distance computation involves numerical integration, which was optimized as follows:

- **Reduced integration points**: The number of points used in the trapezoidal rule was reduced (e.g., from 1000 to 500), striking a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy.
- **Vectorized integration**: Operations were combined to minimize kernel launches and maximize GPU parallelism during the integration.

---

### 4. Incremental Writing of Results
To further manage memory usage:

- Results for each batch were directly written to disk (in CSV or Excel format) after processing.
- This avoided holding the full distance matrix in memory and allowed processing of large datasets efficiently.

---

### 5. Optimized GPU Utilization
The following changes ensured maximum GPU utilization:

- **Increased batch size**: Larger batch sizes (e.g., 500 rows/columns) ensured more data was fed into the GPU in a single kernel launch, improving parallelism.
- **Minimized CPU-GPU transfers**: Data was transferred between CPU and GPU only when absolutely necessary, reducing synchronization overhead.
